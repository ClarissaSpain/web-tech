## Homework 3 ReadMe

Read me for HW 3 in Web Tech and Project 1 Interactive Performance where I
incorporate Voice recognition software to choose my options.

### What I did/logic/problems:

I wrote out the base logic (without thinking about syntax) of how I wanted this
mini-game to work. I had already written out the script for it, but part of the
script required the participate to choose from a set of four objects(for me
it was tables at a marketplace), experience
one of them and then go back to the page that asked which table they wanted to go
to and then go to that table again.
At this point I wanted the end the function and go to the next event that I called
"Random Event Encounter", that chose from three different options randomly.
After Random Event Encounter, I wanted to be sure each user ended with the
mysterious black scroll.

After talking to Colton, he recommended that I use a recursive function. So that
after 2 tables the function will have a break case and stop looping.
And immediately move forward to the Random Encounters Event.

For me css became the last part of the project as I was on a bit of a time
crunch for this assignment.
