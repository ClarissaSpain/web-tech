### Homework 12

Phaser.io is definitely really interesting! I had a lot of fun player around with the physics. Its almost like a tiny game engine.

I couldn't quite get my new sprite right? I changed the frame width and then I went into my psd file to change the distance between the sprites and I still couldn't get it right. I think I had some weird math going on. 


Here is what I implemented:

Change the gravity of the stars.@
Use different sprites for the player - look in the assets folder.@
Add more platforms.@
Create different graphics to gather with different values if you get them.@
