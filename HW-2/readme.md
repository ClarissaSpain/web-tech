## Homework 2 Readme

This first introduction to javascript has been pretty straightforward and I'm really glad that I was able to figure it out as I'm sure we're only going to get more complicated from here.

I bought Duckett's "Javascript & JQuery" book about a year ago and it's just been collecting dust on my bookshelf, so I'm glad to actually be able to crack it open.

My only issues technically has more to do with Atom than the language, but I was glad to have figured out how to start a live server from any html file in Atom.

Other than that, this week's homework was pretty simple so I hope having a shorter Readme won't be a terrible thing XD
