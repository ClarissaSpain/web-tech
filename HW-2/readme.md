Execute the log from a separate JavaScript file that you link to from your HTML document.
Use the script tag at the end of your HTML document to do this
The console.log should include;
3 of your favorite websites
3 of your favorite games
3 of your favorite artists (see the theme of the week)
You should set a primary background color for your document using a style element within the HTML documentâ€™s head element.
As always, you should also write a readme.md and put that in your directory. Discuss your progress this week with the introduction to JS and your console example.
