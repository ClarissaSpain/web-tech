Okay, so it's been awhile since I picked up HTML/CSS. I've been so used to Java
these last couple semesters and I didn't really think twice when I went to open
up my text editor to work on homework 1.

So, honestly my biggest pain in the butt with this homework was myself. I would
start to code in java before smacking myself because this is HTML. So, most of my
time spent was simply relearning the language. I think moving forward, though,
I'll be okay.


I'm really glad that this website will be a work in progress, because there's
a lot more that I want to do in terms of design/style. I plan on changing the
font later and somehow adding an art gallery/portfolio.
